# **sofamaxxing**  

Sofamaxxing is an API that scrapes information and sources for anime, movies, and TV series.  
The providers are built both within this project and imported from [Consumet](https://github.com/consumet).  

- ðŸ”¹ **Internal providers:** Designed for **React Native**, using [`react-native-cheerio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cheerio) for web scraping.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Consumet providers:** Directly imported and **not optimized** for React Native.  

Sofamaxxing naturally uses some code from **Consumet**, integrating it with custom solutions to enhance compatibility with React Native.
